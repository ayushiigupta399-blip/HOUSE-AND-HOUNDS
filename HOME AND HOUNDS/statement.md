##  Problem Statement
In most neighborhoods, people often struggle to find reliable help for everyday tasks like cleaning the house, fixing small repairs, or taking care of their pets.  
Service providers also don’t always have a simple digital platform where people can easily see what they offer or book an appointment.

To solve this everyday problem, I built a **simple, user-friendly console application** where users can quickly explore available services, read real customer experiences, and book a service without any hassle.

##  Scope of the Project
The aim of this project is to design a basic but functional service-booking system that works entirely through the terminal.  
The project covers:

- A clean menu-based interface  
- Three main service categories:
  - Home Repair  
  - Home Cleaning  
  - Pet Care  
- A booking form that collects user details step-by-step  
- In-memory storage for all bookings  
- Display of service highlights and testimonials  

This project focuses on simplicity and clarity.  
It **does not** include advanced features such as:
- Login or authentication  
- Payment processing  
- Database integration  
- Internet-based services

##  Target Users
The application is designed for:
- Residents who want quick access to trustworthy local services  
- Small service providers who want a simple digital booking interface  
- Students or beginners who want to understand how interactive programs are built  
- Community organizations that need a basic service directory system

##  High-Level Features
###  Easy-to-Use Menu
A simple navigation menu that lets users quickly jump between options.

###  Service Highlights
Clear descriptions of what each service includes, so users know exactly what they’re choosing.

###  Client Testimonials
Short, friendly reviews from fictional clients that make the system feel more real and trustworthy.

###  Booking Form
A guided, step-by-step process where users enter:
- Their name  
- Phone number  
- Address  
- Preferred service  
- Preferred date and time  

The system automatically creates:
- A unique booking ID  
- A timestamp for admin reference  

###  Non-Functional Strengths
- **Very easy to use** — Even non-technical users can navigate the menu  
- **Reliable** — Inputs are validated to reduce mistakes  
- **Lightweight & fast** — Runs instantly since it’s pure Python  
- **Maintainable** — Built using a clean, modular class structure
